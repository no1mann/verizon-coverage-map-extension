# Verizon Coverage Map mmWave - Chrome Extension
This Chrome extension change's the color of mmWave coverage on the official Verizon Coverage Map on Chromium-based browsers.

# Background
After Verizon launched C-Band on January 2022, Verizon made the decision to combine C-Band and mmWave coverage into the same color on their coverage map. This extension reverts that change and gives mmWave its own, unique color.

# How To Install
1. Click the green "Code" button at the top of this page and click "Download ZIP"
2. Extract the contents of the ZIP file to a permanent location
3. In Chrome, type in this into your address bar to manage your Chrome extensions
> chrome://extensions
4. Toggle on "Developer mode" located at the top, right hand side of the page
5. Click the "Load unpacked" button at the top, left of the page
6. Select the folder you just unzipped (it should contain a mainfest.json file)
7. You then should see "Verizon Coverage Map - mmWave" in your extensions list. Go to the official Verizon coverage map and you should see mmWave coverage in a different color

# Disclaimer
All mmWave data comes directly from Verizon. I can not speak for the validity of the coverage and I'm unaware of how often they update the coverage.
