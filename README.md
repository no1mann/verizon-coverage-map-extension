# Verizon Coverage Map Chrome Extension
Change's the color of mmWave coverage on the official Verizon Coverage Map on Chromium-Based Browsers.

# Background
After the launch of C-Band in January, Verizon made the decision to combine C-Band and mmWave coverage into the same color. This extension reverts that change and gives mmWave its own, unique color.

# Download
Download from the Chrome Web Store [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/verizon-coverage-map-mmwa/onbpjfegjabhpbfnidnmdbgmaefachdp)

# How To Install Locally
1. Click the green "Code" button at the top of page and click "Download ZIP"
2. Extract the contents of the ZIP file to a folder
3. In Chrome, type in this into the address bar
> chrome://extensions
4. Turn on "Developer mode" in the top, right hand side of the screen
5. Click the "Load unpacked" button at the top, left of the screen
6. Select the folder you just unzipped (it should contain a mainfest.json file)
7. You then should see "Verizon Coverage Map - mmWave" in your extensions list. Go to the official 5G Verizon coverage map and you should see mmWave coverage in a different color

# Disclaimer
All mmWave data comes directly from Verizon. I can not speak for the validity of the coverage and I'm unaware of the last time they updated it.
